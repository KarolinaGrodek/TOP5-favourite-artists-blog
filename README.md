# "My TOP5 favourite artists" - blog
Hello, there is a simple and short sort of blog about favourite artists.
Contains: HTML div structure, CSS styling, links (youtube, Instagram), images, sidebar which move you to the article you're interested in (with using scrollTo function in JS for some nice animation) and scroll up button (not display yet, I need better png)
I'm currently working on make the sidebar sticky to the top during scrolling (many troubles with this rn)
